### TadavomnisT

I am Behrad.B, an open-source programmer and computer researcher. I recieved my BSc from SUT and am currently pursuing an MSc in Software-ENG at the same institution. My thesis lies in resource management in edge computing, but I have a certain interest in a broad-spectrum of fields including cryptography, open-source technologies, privacy-preserving tools, free software, algorithms, operating systems, web and network protocols, compression algorithms, image processing, artificial intelligence, system architectures, security, GNU/Linux, medical systems, and etc...
